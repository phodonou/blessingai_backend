Nations qualified teams by placing in the top six at the 2021 World Curling Championships. Teams could also qualify through Olympic qualification events which were held in 2021. Six nations qualified via World Championship qualification placement, while three nations qualified through qualification events. In men's and women's play, a host will be selected for the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE). They would be joined by the teams which competed at the 2021 World Championships but did not qualify for the Olympics, and two qualifiers from the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event (Pre-OQE). The Pre-OQE was open to all member associations.[5]\n",

This OQE was open to a nominated host and the fifteen nations with the highest qualification points not already qualified to the Olympics. As the host nation, China qualified teams automatically, thus making a total of ten teams per event in the curling tournaments.[6]\n",

Only residents of the People's Republic of China were permitted to attend the Games as spectators. The National Hockey League (NHL) withdrew their players' participation in the Games' men's hockey tournament, citing concerns over COVID-19 and the need to make up games that had been postponed due to COVID-19 outbreak. Ticket sales to the general public were canceled, and limited numbers of spectators were admitted by invitation only. The My2022 mobile app was used for submissions of customs declarations and health records for travel to the Games, daily health self-reporting, and records of COVID-19 vaccination and testing. Some top athletes, considered to be medal contenders, were not able to travel to China after having tested positive, even if asymptomatic. There were also complaints from athletes and team officials about quarantine facilities and conditions. Finally, there were 437 total coronavirus cases detected and reported by the Beijing Organizing Committee since January 23, 2022.\""
